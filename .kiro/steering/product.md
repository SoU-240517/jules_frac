# Fractal Generator Application

This is a PyQt6-based fractal visualization application that generates and renders complex mathematical fractals like Mandelbrot and Julia sets. The application features:

- Interactive fractal exploration with real-time parameter adjustment
- Plugin-based architecture for fractal algorithms and coloring schemes
- High-resolution image export capabilities
- Colormap editor for custom color schemes
- Preset management system for saving/loading configurations
- Multi-language support (Japanese interface elements)

The application is designed for both casual exploration and advanced mathematical visualization, with performance optimization through Numba JIT compilation for fractal calculations.
